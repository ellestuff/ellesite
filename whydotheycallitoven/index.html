			<h2><u>what?</u></h2>
			<p>if you stumbled upon this page my accident somehow, then congrats! i don't know why or how you thought to do this.</p>
			<p>surprise~! i draw big proportions and weird deviantart-type fetish things.</p>
			
			<br><p>...i started making this section back when i had 16+ socials to link.</p>
			<p>i used to have a deviantart but i deleted it bc too many little kids were interacting with it</p>
			<p>don't use deviantart, that place sucks.</p>
			<p>i only still have this page for the funnies.</p>
			
			<br><p>i'll probably add a gallery for this stuff eventually, but for now this page is all you get.</p>
